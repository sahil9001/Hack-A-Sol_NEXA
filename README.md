### Prblem Statement : 3

## Problem :

The Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has trampled the health care system of many countries. Blood transfusion services in any hospital, hold the prime location and ensure smooth functioning of all elective and urgent surgical interventions of fatal diseases like leukemia, lymphoma, Eosinophilia etc. In the wake of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, just like many other sectors of the health care system, Blood transfusion services and blood
banks are also struggling to cope up with the unforeseen challenges.

In order to make Blood Drive Services more approachable, we want you to build a client-side mobile application that can schedule appointments and let them know if a blood drive is near their location. It should also be capable of push notifications in the event of a nearby blood drive. You are also required to build an organizer-side application that can accept applications and organize blood drives.

## Solution :

# Sanjeevani

Here is **Team NEXA** with -

**_A complete solution with a personalised app and admin portal, with a special social distancing monitor and KYC verification model, which will make the process convenient, effective and hassle free._**

### **Features of Sanjeevani** - _Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Models_

1. AI - Adhaar Card Details Validation
   - In this model we are validating every information given in the aadhaar card with the details filed by the patient in the application form .
   - We are achieving this with help of pytesseract library which helps in Optical Character Recognition
   - We are applying different kernels and image processing methods in order to get the best result from aadhar card.
   - In future we are thinking OTP verification too , In order to increase our security.
2. AI - Face Recognition
   - In this model we are validating that the person who filed the form is the same person getting the at the center.
   - To achieve this we are taking a picture of the person while filing the application form and validating the image with the person's face who came at the hospital for blood transfusion, we are using face_recognititon library in order to get perfect accuracy.

### **Features of Sanjeevani** - _Web_
